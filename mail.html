Hi Arun,

As discussed, below I've mentioned reasons/concerns for my resignation. 

1. Dependents' Medical Insurance: Due to the unavailability of the system in the initial days, there is some delay in updating dependents for medical insurance.
   Post that got to know I can't register them till 2022. Also, I have no chance to get them insured through private insurance organizations.

2. I have a great urge to work in new technologies like React(already have experience in previous organizations). But the required platform is never provided.

3. Expecting onsite opportunities.

    Attaching my updated resume. Kindly do the needful

    
Thanks
Praveen
